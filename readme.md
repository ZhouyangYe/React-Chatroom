This is a simple chat room based on ReactJS, Redux and Socket.io.

To run the app:
 
First of all, clone this repository to your computer or simply download it. NodeJS must be installed.

Go into React-Chatroom(root folder): `cd React-Chatroom`

Then run `npm install` on the terminal in the root folder to install all the dependencies.

After dependencies are installed:

I'm using nodemon here as a development tool,

Run `npm install nodemon -g` to install nodemon globally.

Then run `npm start` to start the app, and the server is listening to port:8888.

If don't want to install nodemon, can simply run `npm run compile` to compile and after it's done, run `node app.js` to run the server.
